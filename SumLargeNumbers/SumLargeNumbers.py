# Hey there, jolly Pythonistas! Welcome to our little project called "SumLargeNumbers". 
# All it does is add two large numbers together. And when I say large, I mean LARGE!
# Let's say you have two numbers that are so big that not even your calculator can't handle them. No worries!
# This script has got your back as it can handle numbers of any length. Isn't that fun?
# So let's just dive into it!

# Defining a function named 'add_large_numbers'.
# It takes in two parameters, num1 and num2, which are strings representing large numbers.
def add_large_numbers(num1, num2):
  # Built-in Python function int() is used to convert the large numbers from string format to integer.
  # The addition operation is then carried out.
  # In the end, the result is converted back to a string format using the built-in str function and returned.
  return str(int(num1) + int(num2)) 

# This little piece code down here is calling the 'add_large_numbers' function.
# Two large numbers are passed as strings.
# Then, the result is printed out.
# This way, we can see the result directly on the command line after running the script.
# How cool is that?
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(add_large_numbers("12345678901234567890", "12345678901234567890")) 

# And there we have it! A simple, no-brainer summation!
# It is fast, efficient, and works on any Python platform.
# No need for any third-party library or internet access!
# Perfect for a fresh Python environment.
# This is pure Pythonic joy if you ask me! :P
