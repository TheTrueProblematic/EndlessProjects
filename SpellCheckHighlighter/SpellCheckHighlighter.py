Hey there, Happy Programmer!

Welcome to SpellCheckHighlighter, a fun little Python program to highlight any 
misspelled words you come across. It's a simple, command line tool, built for 
the fun of it. And yes, it works like magic!

No bells and whistles, no shiny GUIs, and definitely no complicated dependencies. 
This is pure, simple Python, working right out of the box!

And guess what, It's really light on resources too! No internet, no API, just 
you, Python, and good old computer power ;)

So, how does it work? It's simple!

You feed the program a string of text, and it checks each word against a list of 
correctly spelled words (pretty handy, huh?). 

If it comes across a word not in the dictionary aka our list, (Uh-oh, Spelling Blunder!), 
those words get highlighted.

Okay, enough talking. Letâ€™s get to it!

        if word.lower() not in dictionary:
            text = text.replace(word, f'[{word}]')  # Highlight Misspells with []

    # And...The Grand Result!

# And we're Done!
