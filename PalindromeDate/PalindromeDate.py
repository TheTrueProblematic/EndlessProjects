# Hello, fellow coder! Who doesn't love a little mystery wrapped in our code?
# Welcome to - PalindromeDate - the whodunit of date programs!
# The program's mission, if you choose to accept it, is to seek out and present to you,
# every date that's a palindrome. You know, those dates that read the same backwards as forwards?
# So, sit back, sip your coffee, and watch those charming palindromes appear!

# Let's get started with our Python recipe, no additional ingredients required. 
# This will work with a completely fresh python installation and doesn't need internet, API or any pesky dependencies.

import datetime

def is_palindrome(input_str):
    # The good ol' palindrome test â€“ it checks if our string reads the same backwards!
    return input_str == input_str[::-1]

def get_palindrome_dates(start_year, end_year):
    # Prepare your calendar, we're going on a palindrome journey!
    for year in range(start_year, end_year+1):
        for month in range(1, 13):
            for day in range(1, 32):
                # We try and except since not all months contain 31 days. 
                # For instance, February trying to don a 31-day mask won't fool us.
                try:
                    date_obj = datetime.datetime(year, month, day)
                    date_str = date_obj.strftime('%m%d%Y')  # Here we go with mmddyyyy format
                    if is_palindrome(date_str):
                        # We found one! A rare palindrome date in its natural habitat, awesome!
                        yield date_obj.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')  # yields our date one at a time
                except ValueError:
                    # Oops, we walked into the nonexistent date trap, but we'll brush it off and keep going.
                    continue

# Now, let's put our little palindrome seeker to test.

# We launched our expedition in 1000 AD and will push through till 9999 AD, 
# bravely treading where no bot has tread before!
for date in get_palindrome_dates(1000, 9999):
    # Printing those elusive palindromes as they're uncovered. Exciting, isn't it?
    print(date)

# And with the last print, our magical palindrome journey ends.
# But fear not, brave coder, just run it again, and relive the adventure!
# Happy Coding!
