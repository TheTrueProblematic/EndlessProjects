# Howdy Partner! Get ready for an exciting journey in the world of Python and Binary Conversions. 
# We're about to embark on a fun task called BinaryToASCII to, well, convert Binary to ASCII! 
# Only in Python, of course. No fancy UI, no internet, no APIs, no additional python files. Purely Python!

# Importing the magical sys module to help us read arguments from the command line!
import sys

# Defining our function for the conversion.
def binary_to_ascii(binary_string):
    # Let's split every 8 bits because that's how ASCII works!
    # Also Python treats strings like arrays, so it's all good here!
    binary_values = [binary_string[i:i + 8] for i in range(0, len(binary_string), 8)]
    
    # I'll now map each bit to its ASCII equivalent and join them. The magic of Python comprehensions!
    ascii_str = ''.join([chr(int(binary, 2)) for binary in binary_values])
    
    # And Voila! The converted ASCII string is ready to leave the building!
    return ascii_str

# Now, let's wrap around the main function to use our magical binary_to_ascii function.
def main():
    # Gently making sure that we have two arguments (file name and the binary string).
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python binary_to_ascii.py binary_string")
        sys.exit(1)

    # Fetch the binary string from the command line argument.
    binary_string = sys.argv[1]

    # Give the binary_to_ascii function the binary string and let it do the magic.
    ascii_str = binary_to_ascii(binary_string)
    
    # And let's see the result!
    print(ascii_str)

# This is the start of our Python Mt. Everest.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Woohoo! Let's hit the road!
    main()

# And that's it! We've just built a simple Binary to ASCII converter using Python.
# Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy, wasn't it?
# By implementing this, we have avoided the use of a GUI, network requests, and extra dependencies.
# Isn't Python just magical?
