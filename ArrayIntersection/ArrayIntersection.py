# Hooray! We're at the intersection of two arrays. Let's dive right in! This script is designed to find common elements in two arrays.
# It's as easy as pie and uses built-in Python features, so no additional installations required. 

def array_intersection(array1, array2):
    # Python sets are unordered collections of unique elements
    # Using sets to find the intersection ensures that duplicate elements are handled nicely
    intersection_set = set(array1) & set(array2)
    
    # Converting the set back to a list for easier manipulation
    # This step is entirely optional and depends on your personal preference
    intersection_list = list(intersection_set)
    
    return intersection_list

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Defining two arrays with some common elements
    array1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    array2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    
    # Finding the intersection of the two arrays
    # The result should be a new array containing only the common elements: [4, 5, 6]
    print(array_intersection(array1, array2))

# And there you go! A simple, beautiful array intersection being printed right in your command line. No frills, no fancy stuff, just pure Python goodness! 
# Remember, great things are often simple ;)
