# Howdy folks! This here is our fun little script, affectionately dubbed "RandomColorName".
# What does it do? You might ask. Simple! It picks a random color name from a list.
# Much like a colorful surprise, you never know what you're gonna get!

# Importing our only friend in this lonesome plain, the 'random' module.
# Don't worry, it's a standard Python module, so we aren't breaking any rules!
import random

# Here's our kaleidoscope of color names. Gander at it to your heart's content!
color_names = ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Yellow', 'Pink', 'Purple', 'Orange', 'Black', 'White', 'Gray']

# Now, onto the moment you've been waiting for. Drumroll please...

# We use the 'choice' function from our friend Mr.Random to pick a color. 
# Like the blindfolded kid at the piñata party, he has no bias!
random_color = random.choice(color_names)

# After it's been chosen, we display the chosen color. 
# Excitement and anticipation much? Don't worry, thrill's not going away. Run the script again!
print("The randomly selected color is:", random_color)

# And that's all she wrote, folks! Pretty neat, huh? 
# Keep on coding, y'all! Remember, every colourful line of code paints a brighter future!
