# Yay! Let's start a new exciting python adventure to flatten a list of lists into a single list!
# Don't worry; no dragons are involved, only beautiful lists and Python. Let's ride on!

def flatten_list(nested_list):
    """A lovely function that takes in a list of lists and whips it into a single, one-layer list!
    Remember, this is a SAFE space. Nested lists only!

    Parameters:
    -----------
    nested_list : list of lists
        The hierarchical list of lists you want to flatten. Like a layered cake!

    Returns:
    --------
    flattened_list : list
        Our final gift to the world! A single list! All elements of all sublists, flat as a pancake!
    """

    # It's time to unfold the magic of Python list comprehension!
    # We will travel through every element in our lovely nested list. 
    # Hey! Even elements of elements (yaks of yaks)!
    flattened_list = [element for sublist in nested_list for element in sublist]

    # Here is your lovely, homely, single-layered list. Treat it well!
    return flattened_list


# How about a quick test run with our lovely function? I assume you have a nested list at hand!
# If not, don't worry; I always carry a spare! 
# nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
# print(flatten_list(nested_list))

# Did you see that? How every individual sublist knitted beautifully into a single list?!
# Pythonic magic, isn't it? ;)

# This Python adventure ends here, but fear not! There's always another fantastical journey around the corner!
