#Oh boy am I glad to see you! Welcome to the RectangularPrismVolume file! 
#In this little program, we're going to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism. All you need to know is the Length, Width, and Height! Easy, right?

#Let's start by accepting user inputs for width, height and length. We're going to assume the measurements are in cm because we like to keep things simple around here ;)

print("Welcome to Rectangular Prism Volume Calculator!")
length = float(input("Enter the length (cm): "))
width = float(input("Enter the width (cm): "))
height = float(input("Enter the height (cm): "))

#Now let's calculate that volume, shall we? This is what we came here for after all. 

def calculate_volume(l, w, h):
    #The constraints mentioned no GUI or API or even Internet access but didn't say anything about happy thoughts and good vibes. Let's multiply those!
    volume = l * w * h
    
    #And voila, we have the volume! Let's return it so we can use it outside of this function or maybe throw a small party.
    return volume

volume = calculate_volume(length, width, height)

#Now we just print out the volume with a nice message. Because everyone loves nice messages, right?
print("The volume of the prism is: ", volume, "cubic cm!")

#And that's all she wrote! Thanks for stopping to pass by this humble python script. Calculating volumes, bringing joy, making the world a better place, one prism at a time.
