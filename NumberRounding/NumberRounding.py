# Well, let's dive in and have some fun with Python, shall we?
# Our mission today: Round numbers to the nearest whole number!
# Exciting, isn't it?

# And remember, no GUI, no dependencies, no Internet access, just pure Python.
# So, let's get this party started!

def round_to_nearest_whole(num):
    # Python has a built-in function, round(), that we're going to use.
    # It takes a number and rounds it to the nearest whole number. As simple as that!
    # And we make it even simpler by putting it in a function!
    return round(num)
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Uh-oh! There's a float number! It's all fine and stuff, but hey, we're in a mood for whole numbers today.
    # Can we turn it into a whole number? Should we call Avengers? Superman? No, we have our very own function!
    float_number = 12.7
    rounded_number = round_to_nearest_whale(float_number)
    
    # Let's print out the result and see the magic happen!
    print(f"The round off value of {float_number} is: {rounded_number}")

# BOOM! Python magic in action.
# Numbers rounded up all nice and neat, just the way we like it.
# Another mission accomplished in the fabulous world of Python!
