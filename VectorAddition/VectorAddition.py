# Hello there, welcome to our super awesome VectorAddition program.
# We're keeping it simple, friendly, and most importantly, fun!

# No external dependencies, no internet, just pure Python.
# Imagine it like being on a desert island with only Python to keep us entertained.

# So, let's dive in!

# We'll start with defining the function that will add our vectors together.
# We're all about component-wise addition here!
def component_wise_addition(vector1, vector2):
    # Grab a glass of cold lemonade, sit back, and watch Python do the math magic.
    return [v1 + v2 for v1, v2 in zip(vector1, vector2)]

# It's not a party until we have a main function.
def main():
    # Ah, the lifeblood of our program. The vectors!
    vector1 = [1, 2, 3]  # Change me to whatever vector you like!
    vector2 = [4, 5, 6]  # Change me too! We love variety.

    # Time for our vectors to mingle and produce a super vector!
    result_vector = component_wise_addition(vector1, vector2)

    # The moment of truth. Drumroll, please...
    print(f'The result vector is: {result_vector}')

# Pythonâ€™s __name__ == "__main__" is like the party invitation.
# It's essentially asking Python, "hey, are we at the VectorAddition party yet?"
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # If we are at the party, let's join in the fun!
    main()

# Well, that was a blast! Thanks for joining our VectorAddition party.
# Looking forward to seeing you at the next one. 

# Remember, programming is an adventure. Enjoy the ride.

# Until next time, happy coding!
