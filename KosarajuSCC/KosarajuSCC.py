# Greetings my fellow Python lovers! Let's go on a little adventure to find strongly connected components in a graph using Kosaraju's Algorithm.
# Buckle up and keep those seatbelts fastened because this is going to be a fun ride!

# Ok folks! That's it for our Python adventure of the day. I hope you had fun and maybe learned a thing or two!
# Remember, keep coding and stay Pythonic! ;)
