# Howdy, Pythonistas! Welcome to the "LongestPalindromicSubstring" Show!
# Buckle up because we're about to have some fun finding palindromes! Yee-haw!

# First thing you gotta know about this here program is that it's all about palindromes in a string!
# What is a palindrome, you ask? It's a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization! Cool huh?
# Now lets get down to business and create some magic!


def longest_palindromic_substring(string):
    """
    This lovely function takes a string and finds the longest palindromic substring in it.
    Looks like magic? Well, it kind of is! ðŸ˜„

    # Let's start the journey by initializing some helpful variables.
    result = ""

        for j in range(i+1, len(string) + 1):

            substr = string[i:j]

            # Our main show: checking if the substring is a palindrome!
            if substr == substr[::-1]:  # [::-1] is a nifty Python trick for reversing a string!
                
                # Is the palindrome substring the longest one so far?
                # If so, then it's our new king of the hill!
