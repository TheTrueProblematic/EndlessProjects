# Well, hello beautiful human (or adorable robot, no discrimination here!)
# My name is BinaryToHex.py, I'm a simple Python script with the duty to convert binary numbers into their lovely hexadecimal equivalents.
# Remember me when you gaze at a beautiful sunset or a fancy flock of binary numbers (yes, binary numbers travel in flocks!). I'm your guy when it's time to bring them to the hexadecimal world.

# Let's pack our bags and hit this binary to hexadecimal journey!

# Let's start by defining a function named binary_to_hex
# This function will put in the work to convert the given binary number into a hexadecimal one.
def binary_to_hex(binary):
    # Python's int function has this cool trick where it can convert the binary bits into an integer.
    # We just pass it the binary number (as a string) and tell it that the number is base 2.
    # It's like telling it "hey pal, we're in binary world now!"
    int_num = int(binary, 2)

    # But we're not here to make integer numbers, are we? No, we're here for the shiny, shiny hexadecimal!
    # So, Python's hex function is gonna be our hero now. It will take the integer number we got and return a string that represents that number in base 16 (hexadecimal).
    # We should note here that hex returns a string that starts with "0x" to indicate that it's a hexadecimal number.
    # But our inter-galactic regulations specify that we should only print the hexadecimal number. No "0x" allowed.
    # So we use Python's string slicing to skip the first 2 characters ("0x").
    hex_num = hex(int_num)[2:]

    # And there you have it! Our binary number has been transformed into a brilliant, glowing hexadecimal...
    # Oops, got carried away... Uh, I mean, the function returns the hexadecimal number. Peace out!
    return hex_num

# Oh, almost forgot! We need to make sure our script is called directly (not being imported to another one) to begin the action.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Now my friend, we need to talk to our user. Let's ask them to give us the binary number.
    # We'll use Python's input function for this. And we'll store the user's answer in a variable named binary_input.
    binary_input = input("Dear, splendid user, please input a binary number: ")

    # Our binary_to_hex function is eager to do its job. Let's call it with the binary number we got from the user.
    hex_output = binary_to_hex(binary_input)

    # And finally, the moment of truth. We print the hexadecimal number out! This is it, amigo. Our journey ends here.
    print("Dear, world-class user, the hexadecimal equivalent of your binary number is: ", hex_output)

# And that's a wrap! I've enjoyed our adventure. Got to convert binary numbers to hexadecimals, saw amazing sights, and made a new friend!
# I'll be waiting here if you ever need to embark on this journey again. Bring a hat next time, the binary bits can get quite bright!
