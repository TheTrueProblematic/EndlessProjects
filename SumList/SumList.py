# Hello there! Today's mission is simple but no less important. It's a major player in our code world.
# We're going to write a Python script that sums up all the elements from a list.
# Keep in mind, great things often come in tiny packages and, boy, isn't this code one a gem!

# Inputs will come from the command line so let's get crackin', shall we?

# Wham, bam, import ma'am (or sir).
import sys

def sum_list(numbers):
    # It's crunchin' time. Let's sum the elements in the list.
    # Drumroll please...and..the total is...
    return sum(numbers)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Buckle your seatbelts folks! Here's where we take a list of numbers from the command line.
    # My, oh my, aren't we living in the future?
    # We're assuming these are all numbers. If they're not, we'll crash. 
    # But hey, rules are rules. You've gotta trust me on this one.
    numbers = [int(num) for num in sys.argv[1:]]

    # Let's calculate the total and print it on the screen.
    # Anticipation is killing me...
    total = sum_list(numbers)
    
    print(f"The sum is: {total}")
    # And there you have it - we've summed up all the numbers. 
    # Another wonderful day in coding paradise. Catch you on the flip side!

# At last, I'd like to emphasize that this script is simpler than a C major scale on the piano, 
# therefore it should run smoothly on any platform.
# Also, as promised, here it is, all wrapped up in a single file, no extra baggage to carry.
# So let's get this Python party started!
