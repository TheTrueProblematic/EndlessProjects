# Heyo future coders! Today we're going to be wrangling some text! ðŸ¤ 
# Specifically, we're going to make a TextJustifier, 
# a script that fully justifies text to a specified line width. 
# We're keeping it pure Python, no extra dependencies, no GUI, and definitely no internet. 
# So sit back, grab a cup of coffee, and let's dive in!
