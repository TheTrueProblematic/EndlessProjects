# Hello future explorer of this fun little Python script!
# Ever wanted to solve a cool problem? Well, look no further!
# Here, we'll find the maximum difference between any two elements in a list.
# Sound fun? Of course it does! Let's get started!

# First, we'll start by defining our function 'max_difference'
# This takes one argument, a list of numbers, we'll call it 'numbers'.

def max_difference(numbers):

    # Lists are great, aren't they? But they're not so great when they're empty. So let's check for that first.
    # If the list is empty, we'll return an error message. 
    if not numbers:
        return "Oops! Looks like your list is empty. Please provide a list with at least two numbers."

    # Now, let's find the maximum and the minimum values in the list.
    # The built-in max() and min() functions make this super easy!
    max_value = max(numbers)
    min_value = min(numbers)

    # And now the moment you've all been waiting for - drum roll please -
    # The biggest difference between any two numbers in the list is just the difference between the max and min! Woah!
    max_diff = max_value - min_value

    # There you have it, folks! We'll return this difference and call it a day.
    return max_diff

# Now, let's use our nifty function on a list for some immediate gratification.
# Feel free to try your own list!
print("The max difference in the list is:", max_difference([3, 2, 9, 5, 7, 1]))

# And there you have it! You've successfully traversed through the script.
# Happy coding!
