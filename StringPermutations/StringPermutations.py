# Honk honk! Here comes the Python express with yet another fun hashtable adventure!
# Today's quest: Finding all permutations of an input string!
# Fasten your seatbelts and keep your hands, arms and code inside the Python IDE at all times!

import itertools

def find_string_permutations(input_string):
    # Ahoy! Welcome aboard the permutation-generator ship! We're setting sail on the high seas of computer memory, where x marks the spot!
    
    # First, we need to convert the input string into a list. This makes it easier to work with and manipulate.
    # Yo ho ho and a bottle of O(1), here we go!
    str_list = list(input_string)

    # Now that we've got our list, let's toss it into the Python's itertools permutation generator.
    # You might be wondering, "But why can't we just write our own permutation generator from scratch?"
    # Well, matey, we could indeed... But why reinvent the wheel, when Python's itertools is a finely-tuned, fully-armed battlecruiser ready to obliterate these computational waves?
    # So we let itertools do the heavy lifting! Arrr!
    perm_gen = itertools.permutations(str_list)

    # Here's where the magic happens. We take each permutation (which is a tuple) and join it back together into a string.
    # Each joined string becomes an item in our list of all permutations.
    # Shiver me timbers, isn't Python grand?
    all_permutations = [''.join(perm) for perm in perm_gen]

    # And now, we set a course for Perm-utation Island, where all our strings live in harmony!
    # We'll deliver these generated permutations to the awaiting populace.
    # Thanks for choosing the Python permutation-generator ship, we hope you've enjoyed the voyage!
    return all_permutations

# Ahoy, you scurvy dog! Time to test out our permutation generator!
# Let's give it a string and see what it spits out.
# print(find_string_permutations("abc"))

# With that, our little Python express pulls into the station. Thanks for coming along on this journey!
# It's been a wild ride through the exciting world of permutations and, as always, remember to keep your compilers happy and your code even happier.
# Until next time, happy coding!
