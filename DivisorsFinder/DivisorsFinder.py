Hey there! Welcome to the magical world of the 'DivisorsFinder'!ðŸ˜Š
Our radiant little python script, that brings immense joy by helping you find all the divisors for a certain number.
Isn't that cool?ðŸ˜‰
Kicking off with an active web of no internet access at all, our script is totally self-reliant like a boss! Besides, no GUI! We are keeping it all classy and vintage here!
Let's dive in, shall we?ðŸ˜ƒ
