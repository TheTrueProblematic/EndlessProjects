# Hello there, fellow Pythonistas and those new to this fantastic programming language!
# You're currently gazing upon a fun little Python script that performs a very 
# useful task for just about everyone dealing with matrices - it flattens them!

# That's right, you heard it, a 2D matrix will bow down to our programming 
# prowess and surrender its structure to become a 1D array.

# Now, seeing as a command-line interface is our only domain and we don't 
# want any pesky dependencies creeping in, we'll use pure, vanilla Python. 

# Let's get cracking, shall we?

def flatten_matrix(matrix):
    """Flattens a 2D matrix into a 1D array."""

    # Python offers a fun and quick way of achieving this through list comprehension!
    # Isn't Python just delightful? üêç

    # We'll go through each row in the matrix
    # Then, for each row, we'll go through each column 
    # Finally, we'll snatch up the value sitting there and append it into our 1D array (Well, list, really, but let's just go with array for now)

    flattened_array = [value for row in matrix for value in row]
    
    # And voila! Our 2D matrix has been squashed into a simple 1D array!
    # Now we'll return it back into the wild Python world.
    return flattened_array 

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Let's test this bad boy out with a simple 2D array (a list of lists in Python parlance)
    array_2d = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] # A classic example

    # We'll feed this to our function and see what it spits out
    array_1d = flatten_matrix(array_2d)

    # Look! A wild print statement appears! let's use it to see our flattened array.
    print(array_1d)  # Could it be? Yes! It's a 1D array! We did it, hooray!

# And there we have it! A sweet, simple Python script that reduces all 
# high-and-mighty 2D matrices to humble 1D arrays. Run this script from the command-line world and see the magic happen.

# Have a great day, and keep Pythoning! üöÄ
