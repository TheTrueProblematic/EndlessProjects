# Hello there! Welcome to this fun python script!
# I'm your friendly neighborhood programmer, who wrote this script with a big smile on my face! ðŸ˜„
# Now, let's dive in! We've got a task to complete and that's to merge two dictionaries into one.

def merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):
    # Aha, hold on! Before we proceed any further, let's make sure we know what this function does.
    # It simply takes in two dictionaries (dict1 and dict2 as parameters) and merges them into one.
    # Easy peasy, lemon squeezy, isn't it?
    # So now, let's bring in some python magic!

    # The ** operator is used to unpack keys and values of each dictionary and we
    # pass these as arguments to the dict(). So the dict() takes the values from 
    # the second dict2 if it comes across duplicate keys. Hence, the order matters here!
    merged_dict = {**dict1, **dict2}

    # Voila! We have a new dictionary which is a combination of dict1 and dict2.
    # Exciting, isn't it? Now let's make sure everyone gets to see this combined dictionary.
    # So, out it goes to whoever called this function!
    return merged_dict

# Well, there you have it! A simple, straightforward function that does its job perfectly.
# It's been awesome explaining all this to you. Hope you had as much fun as I did. ðŸ˜ƒ
# Keep coding and spread the joy of programming! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽˆ
