# Hey there, fellow Pythonista! Today, we're on an exciting journey to find the smallest number in a list.
# Sit tight, relax, and enjoy the ride! The goal here is simple, but the journey is all the fun.

# Again, remember our friendly house rules:
# Stick to the Python standard library. No outside imports for us, no sir! 
# Our trusty companion throughout will be good ol' Python, which does everything we need.

# First things first, let's start off with defining a function to find the smallest number in a list

def find_smallest(numbers_list):
    """
    This function takes a list of numbers as input
    Then it finds and returns the smallest number in the list
    """

    # Python's min() function is a real lifesaver here.
    # It's a built-in function to find the smallest item in an iterable (like a list) or among two or more arguments.
    
    # Want to know something fun? Python evaluates the smallest item based on the comparisons done via the less than ("<") operator.
    smallest_num = min(numbers_list) 
    
    # We're not just going to keep the smallest number, we're going to share it with the world, or at least the part of the world running this function.
    return smallest_num

# Now, let's take this sleek function for a ride
if __name__ == '__main__':

    # We create a list of some groovy numbers
    my_cool_numbers = [23, 45, 1, -10, 8]

    # Time for the limelight, find_smallest!
    smallest_number = find_smallest(my_cool_numbers)
    
    # Time to showcase our smallest number
    print(f"The smallest number from the list is {smallest_number}")

# And with that, our journey is over.
# We just made a list of numbers a bit less intimidating. Well, at least for us Pythonists!
# Until next time, keep coding, keep learning, and above all keep exploring. Python hath unending secrets!
