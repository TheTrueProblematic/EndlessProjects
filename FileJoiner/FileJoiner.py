# Hey there, fellow programmer! Welcome to this wonderful piece of code.
# This is a fun utility named 'FileJoiner' that combines multiple file chunks back into a single file.
# Sit back, grab a cup of coffee and enjoy the ride! 

# We're starting with importing the sys module.
# This native python module helps us to use the system-specific parameters and functions.
import sys

# Let's define the main function where all the magic happens!
def main():
    # Collect the names of all the files that we are going to join.
    # We'll get them from the command line arguments
    file_chunks = sys.argv[1:]
    
    # Just checking if we got the correct file names or not.
    # If not, the program will gently remind you, the user, to provide the correct ones.
    if len(file_chunks) < 2:
        print("Please provide the names of at least two files to join. Example: python filejoiner.py file1.txt file2.txt")
        return
    
    # Now, get prepared to witness the true file joining magic! 
    # We'll join the files and create a whole new file, 'joined_file.txt'.
    with open('joined_file.txt', 'w') as outfile:
        for fname in file_chunks:
            with open(fname) as infile:
                # Here, read data from input file and write to output file. As simple as such!
                outfile.write(infile.read())
    
    # That's it! You did it! A message for the happpy moment!
    print("Files have been successfully joined. Check out 'joined_file.txt' for the magic!")

# Best practice: use this line to make sure the script doesn't execute when imported as a module.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# Man, that was fun, wasn't it? Remember, a happy programmer is a productive programmer. 
# Hope you enjoyed this little adventure. See you next time with more amazing Python code! Rock on!
