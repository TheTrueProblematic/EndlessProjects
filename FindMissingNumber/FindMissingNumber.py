# Hey, fellow coders, I hope you're having a splendid day! 
# This script is your companion on a 'hide and seek' adventure to find a missing number in a list of consecutive numbers.

def find_missing_number(list_of_numbers):
    """A function to find the missing number in a given list of consecutive numbers.
  
    Parameters:
    list_of_numbers (list): A list of consecutive numbers with one number missing.

    Returns:
    int: The missing number.
    """
  
    # We're calculating the sum of the actual list and the expected list! It's fun, isn't it?
    # The sum function gives us the total of all numbers in a list. But, the missing number... oh, where could it be?
    actual_sum = sum(list_of_numbers)
  
    # Let's imagine for a second here. The list should start with the first number, and go all the way up to the last number (which is the length of our list plus 1, because one pesky number is hiding).  
    expected_sum = sum(range(min(list_of_numbers), max(list_of_numbers) + 1))
  
    # Now comes the fun part. The moment of truth! We subtract actual sum from expected sum, and voila, the mischievous missing number is caught!
    missing_number = expected_sum - actual_sum
  
    # Now that we've found it, let's not keep it a secret. Let's return it so everyone knows which number was playing hide and seek!
    return missing_number

# Just imagine calling this function with a list of numbers and one of them is missing! Oh, the suspense!
# Like this: print(find_missing_number([1, 2, 4, 5, 6]))

# That's it from me. Happy coding, adventurer!
