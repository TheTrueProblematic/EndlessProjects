# Welcome to the Palindrome Number Checker python script!
# This cute little program has one mission in life - to check if a given number is a palindrome or not.
# What is a Palindrome Number, you ask? Well, a Palindrome Number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. Like 16461, for example.
# It's a fun little way to explore some of the magical quirks of numbers in a no-nonsense, command line loving, no-GUI-needed kinda way.
# So, without further ado, let's dive right in!

def is_palindrome_number(number):
  """
  This function will take in a number, reverse its digits and check if the original number and the reversed number are the same.
  If they are the same, Voila! We have a palindrome number. Otherwise, it's just a "regular" number, but we love it anyway.
  
  Args:
    number (int): The number to check.

  Returns:
    bool: True if palindrome, False otherwise.
  """
  # Now to the fun part!
  # Reverse the digits of the input number by converting it to a string, reversing that string, and converting it back to an integer.
  # I know, it sounds a little roundabout but trust me, it's a quick and nifty Python way to reverse the digits of a number.
  reverse_number = int(str(number)[::-1])

  # Now check if the original number and the reversed number are the same.
  # If they are, return True because our number is oh-so-special palindrome number.
  # If not, return False, but remember, our number is still wonderful in its own way.
  return number == reverse_number


# And that's all folks! A short, sweet, single-python file solution for checking palindrome numbers.
# Spread the command line love and remember, every number has its own charm!
