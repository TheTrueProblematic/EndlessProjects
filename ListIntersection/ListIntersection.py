# Hello from your cheerful coder friend! 😄
# Today we are going to create a fantastic piece of code named 'ListIntersection'.
# Our program will act as a magical tool to find the common elements (a.k.a intersection) of two lists. Exciting, huh? 🎉
# To keep the smile on your face, this code will contain no GUI, no dependencies, no APIs, no internet access, and absolutely will be in Python only! 😊
# Vanilla python in its simplest form, just like a fresh cup of hot coffee on a crisp morning. ☕
# Hop in with me and let's start on our fun coding adventure! 
# Remember: Good code is like a good joke - it needs no explanation! But hey! It's me and I love commenting, so there's plenty of those! 😉

def find_intersection(list1, list2):
    # Oh, what's happening here? 😮
    # This magical line of code is using a thing in Python called a "list comprehension". 
    # It's going through every element in the first list (let's call each one 'element')...
    # And if it finds that same 'element' is in the second list too, it keeps it.
    # The result? You got it! A list of all elements found in both lists! 🍻
    intersection_list = [element for element in list1 if element in list2]

    # The grand result of our magic trick hits the stage. 🎩🐇
    # We dutifully return our findings to the expectant audience (a.k.a the console or the next function in line)!
    return intersection_list

# Woohoo! 🎉 You've been an amazing assistant in this coding journey!
# We did it! A clean, simple function to find the intersection of two lists.
# Next time you need to find common elements just call our function with your lists.
# Remember, code is poetry, so let's keep writing! Happy coding! 😄
