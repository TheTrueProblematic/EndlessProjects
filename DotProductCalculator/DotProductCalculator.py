# Ahoy there fellow code enthusiast!
# I'm your guiding friend and today we'll be embarking on a splendid journey to compute the dot product of two vectors!
# Our journey is contained in this simple yet fun python script that is bound to make our day brighter!
# Now, grab your cup of coffee and let's get started, shall we?
    
def dot_product(vector1, vector2):
    # Don't you just love when math and programming come together? I sure do!
    # The dot product... such a simple mathematical concept, yet so powerful.
    # In case your math is a bit rusty, here's how it goes:
    # Multiply corresponding elements in each vector, then sum all those products.
    # And voila! That's our dot product. Pretty cool, huh?
    
    # First off, letâ€™s do a quick sanity check to make sure our vectors are of the same length!
    if len(vector1) != len(vector2):
        print("The vectors are not of the same length! Can't calculate dot product!")
        return None

    # Now, let's calculate that delicious dot product.
    return sum(i*j for i, j in zip(vector1, vector2))

# Okay, but how do we read vectors from command line? No worries, we got this!
def read_vector_from_input(input_string):
    # The input string should be a sequence of numbers separated by spaces.
    # Let's split that string, convert each element to an integer and then put those numbers in a list.
    # At the end of this function, we'll return that list as our vector.
    
    try:
        # Don't you just love list comprehensions? Pythonic elegance at its best!
        vector = [int(num) for num in input_string.split()]
    except ValueError:
        # If we can't convert some elements to integers, we'll just return None.
        print("Invalid vector input! All elements must be integers.")
        return None

    # Return our freshly made vector.
    return vector

# Its time we get our hands dirty to use both of our defined functions to get the final results. Let's do this!
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('Enter the first vector: ')
    vector1 = read_vector_from_input(input())
    print('Enter the second vector: ')
    vector2 = read_vector_from_input(input())

    # We're ready to calculate the dot product!
    if vector1 is not None and vector2 is not None:
        result = dot_product(vector1, vector2)
        if result is not None:
            print('Dot product: ', result)

# And..... we're done! Not too hard, right? I hope you enjoyed our little journey together!
# Until next time, my fellow code enthusiast!
