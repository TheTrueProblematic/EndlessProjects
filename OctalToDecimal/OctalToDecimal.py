# Hello, my friend! Welcome to the OctalToDecimal python magic converter. 🎩🌟
# This program is going to show you how easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy it is to change from octal to decimal number! 🐙➡️🔟

# Ain't no rest for the wicked - code doesn't grow on trees, 
# so let's not hesitate and dive right into this cool decoding adventure. 🚀

# The first step in our journey is to grab that mysterious octal number from the user.
# We're going to do this by using Python's built-in input function. 🗣️👂
octal_number = input("Hello there, beautiful! Could you please type in your octal number? ")

# Cool! Now that we've got the octal number, let's make some magic happen. 
# We're going to use Python's int function. This wonderful little function
# is going to take our octal number and treat it as base 8 (which is what octals are).
# So, here is our magic spell: 🧙‍♀️
decimal_number = int(octal_number, 8)

# THAT'S IT! Yes, my coding comrade, it really is that simple. Python is doing all the hard work for us.
# All we have to do now is print it for our user.   🎉
print("Here you go, hot stuff! Your decimal number is: ", decimal_number)

# Wasn't that a hoot? I can't wait for our next coding adventure together. Until then, 
# remember: code is just magic waiting to happen! 🧙‍♂️🌟
