# Welcome to the PeanutButterJellyTime TitleCaseConverter!
# ------------------------------
# Imagine, if you would, a magical world where every letter in a title finds its perfect place, 
# Capital letters are indeed capital. Lowercase letters, lower than the basement.
# Well, believe it or not, you're not just imagining. This, my friend, is a reality.
# And reality is right here, in this very Python script!
#
# So grab a cup of coffee, sit back, and watch the spectacle of the beautiful TitleCaseConverter

# As we venture into the wild of python, avoiding dangerous dependencies 
# and fearsome APIs, we stick to the safest of safe - the python standard library

    A function so simple, yet majestic. Takes in a string.

                from dull to Title Case!

    Returns:
    str: The same text, only that it's wearing a new suit, a Title Case suit.

# Ask the user for input - this is where you, the user, come into play.
# In the theater of code, there is only one rule: There are no rules!
# So go ahead, give us a string! Let us unleash the power...The power of the TitleCaseConverter

# Tada! Behold, as we unveil the newly transformed string.
# A string that rose from the ashes of a mundane sentence to be the Title Case legend.

# And that's it for the show, folks! We turned a simple sentence into something special,
# and we did it together! You and this amazing little python script.
# Until next time, keep coding and making the world a fun place to live!
